Throughout the contract, THE INVESTOR and THE MANAGERS will be referred to as THE PARTIES.
The contract is celebrated under the following terms and conditions:
**FIRST: GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE INVESTMENT AGREEMENT**

1.1	THE MANAGERS have developed an investment model based in the game, Axie Infinity (https://axieinfinity.com/), which is a play-to-earn game within the Ethereum Blockchain. THE MANAGERS are seeking investors willing to buy Axies teams (the characters that the gamers use in Axie Infinity). These characters will be used and controlled by THE MANAGERS with the aim of producing Smooth Love Potion (SLP), a cryptocurrency which will be valued in dollars (USDT).

1.2	The sources of return for this investment model are i) the cash flow generated by the sale of SLP generated in Axie Infinity and ii) the sale of the Axies upon liquidation of the asset. This potion/cryptocurrency (SLP) has a market value in dollars since it‚Äôs needed to reproduce the Axies and therefore satisfy the demand of new Axies from new players or existing players that want more teams. THE MANAGERS are going to make their best effort to maximize rentability of the investment.

1.3	THE INVESTOR declares that this opportunity was introduced to him through a virtual meeting and that he understands the specific characteristics of the model and the risks involved. Apart from this, they recognize that their investment is at risk, since its being managed by THE MANAGERS and they don‚Äôt guarantee any type of result, return or daily SLP production. However, THE MANAGER‚ÄôS incentives, as it will be further explained in clause 2.2., are aligned with those of THE INVESTOR, in a way that THE MANAGERS have an incentive to make their best effort to maximize your return on investment.

1.4	THE MANAGERS won‚Äôt be directly in charge of producing the SLP with the Axies playing Axie Infinity, they are going to cede them to players, which will receive a fraction of the SLP produced by themselves. THE MANAGERS, to maximize returns, will demand that the players produce at least 125 SLP per day. If they fail to fill this quota for 3 consecutive days, THE MANAGERS will withdraw their access to their team and find another player.

1.5	THE MANAGERS will only accept Ethereum (ETH) as the currency for the investment made by THE INVESTOR. The transfer of the initial investment (hereinafter referred to as the investment) by THE INVESTOR to the MANAGERS should be sent to the following Ethereum address, through the ERC20 network: [ETHEREUM ADDRESS]. The specific amount and the date of the transaction is detailed in the email in which this contract is attached. The investment is subject to a management fee for THE MANAGERS of 5% of the contributed capital and is charged in the monetary unit received.

1.6	The returns of the investment, which are relevant for the distribution of earnings between THE MANAGERS and THE INVESTOR, will be calculated based on the value of the initial investment in dollars. In this sense, Binance‚Äôs market price for ETH/USDT at the exact time of the transfer will be used to calculate the dollar value.

1.7	The payments made for profits from the management of Axies to THE INVESTOR by THE MANAGERS should be made in Tether (USDT), to a crypto address in Binance that THE INVESTOR should specify to THE MANAGERS through email.

1.8	THE INVESTOR is the owner of the Axies teams purchased by THE MANAGERS, and they have the faculty to request THE MANAGERS the liquidation of the investment and delivery of their capital in any moment (in conjunction with the earnings that are due to him under clause 2.2). However, THE MANAGERS also reserve the right of liquidation and they‚Äôll be able to liquidate the investment in any moment. In any case, THE MANAGERS will have a period of 5 business days, accounting for from the notification of any of THE PARTIES via email, to deliver the capital and respective profits for THE INVESTOR.

1.9	THE MANAGERS are explicitly forbidden from using the capital received from THE INVESTOR for other ends not mentioned in this contract, beyond buying Axies teams and their management. 

1.10	The following contract has an indefinite duration, but will be finalized once the portfolio is liquidated and the distribution of earnings is realized, specified in clause 2.2.

1.11	THE MANAGER has the power to decide how many teams will be purchased for THE INVESTOR and the specific Axies that will comprise them.

1.12	THE MANAGER agrees to:

* Realize monthly reports where THE INVESTOR will be informed about the returns on his investment, on the evolution of variables related to the investment risk (such as the fluctuation in the price of SLP/USDT) and new opportunities of investment within the ecosystem of Non-Fungible Token Gaming.
* Make decisions based on the maximization of returns on the investment provided by THE INVESTOR
* Be transparent with THE INVESTOR in any type of communication with him.
**SECOND: STRUCTURE OF THE INVESTMENT AND COMMISSIONS MODEL**

2.1 THE MANAGERS offer the following and only management strategy for the Axies:
* Risk Minimization Strategy: It consists in liquidating, monthly, the amount of SLP generated by the Axies team/s owned by THE INVESTOR, to be delivered the last day of each month by THE MANAGER as dividends.

2.2 THE MANAGERS generate earnings through 2 types of commissions. The whole commission structure is complex, so a spreadsheet is attached to this contract further explaining how it works.

Regarding commissions, the first type of commissions would be the Management Fee, which consists of a percentage (5%) of the initial investment that THE INVESTOR transfers, this is a one-time fee and its charged in the currency provided (ETH). The second type of commission would be the Performance Fee (ùëÉùêπ%), which would be charged from the net returns of the fund and its calculated using the following formula:

The RNF is the net return of the fund, which is calculated the following way: 

![formula_RNF](https://i.imgur.com/15xVVt3.png) 

Where the total amount of dividends delivered refers to the total received by THE PARTIES. All the formulas mentioned previously use the USDT as monetary unit. USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar, which means its dollar valuation is in a 1:1 ratio.

The payments made to THE MANAGERS for Performance Fees will be realized in two stages: i) during the liquidation of the investment, and ii) as part of the SLP dividends. In any of these stages, if the net returns of the fund of THE INVESTOR don‚Äôt exceed 20%, then THE MANAGERS won‚Äôt charge any type of commission for Performance Fee.

The nature of the Performance Fee affects the way in which the SLP dividends are divided between THE PARTIES. This is due to that, if with the total amount of dividends delivered in a specific month, THE INVESTOR has recovered the initial investment + a 20% in returns, then the next SLP dividend would be subject to a commission because of the Performance Fee, since the RNF would be greater than 20% for that specific period. For every monthly dividend where this happens, THE MANAGERS will receive a 50% of the dividends mentioned in clause 2.1.

At the time of the liquidation of the portfolio, a distribution of earnings will take place, in which the payments for each of THE PARTIES will be determined in the following way:
